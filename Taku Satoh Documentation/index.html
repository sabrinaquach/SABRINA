        <header><h2>Unveiling Taku Satoh</h2></header>
        <p id="para1">Taku Satoh was born in 1955 in Tokyo’s Suginami ward, Japan. Satoh grew up in Nerima ward and has always resided in Tokyo. Satoh’s father was a designer which led him to play with his father’s compass and modeling clay as a child. Baggy pants and record jackets inspired Satoh to start designing and advertising. Satoh graduated from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and majored in Design in 1979. He also completed his graduate studies in 1981 at Tokyo University.</p>
        <p id="para1">Satoh began working for Dentsu, Inc. and later created Taku Satoh Design Office Inc. in 1982. Here, Satoh would develop products for Nikka’s “Pure Malt,” and design well-known packaging designs for top Japanese brands including Lotte’s “Xylitol” chewing gum series and Meiki’s “Oishii Gyunyu” milk. Satoh’s creative process in designing logos is unique in that he approaches logos like architecture in such a way that a logo depends on the structure and design. Satoh emphasizes how building a strong structure creates timeless pieces in an ever-changing world, in which companies can change their designs while keeping the identity of the company as a whole. Moreover, Satoh compares his view of design overall to water which we cannot live without, even saying that “we see water but we aren’t capable of seeing how it connects us.”</p>

        <header><h2>Impact</h2></header>
        <p>Although his designs are minimalistic, subtle, and refined, Satoh’s designs have left impressions on everyday consumers in Japan. He utilizes the foreground color or references traditional packaging ideas that create an impression on consumers' minds. Since his designs are well-known and effective, Satoh has influenced Japan’s future packaging designers. Not only has he inspired a new generation of designers, but his beliefs on design are also inspiring. Satoh believes that from “the perspective of design, there is absolutely nothing that is uninteresting.” His belief that design can come from anything has led him to accumulate countless awards for his designs.
